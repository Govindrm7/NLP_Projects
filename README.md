# Movie Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie ratings by leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.

## Objectives
- Analyze sentiments expressed in movie ratings to gain insights into audience opinions.
- Utilize NLP to process and understand textual data associated with movie reviews.
- Apply AI and ML algorithms to predict sentiments based on textual features.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Classification:** Implement machine learning algorithms for sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) of movie ratings.
- **Textual Feature Extraction:** Leverage NLP techniques to extract meaningful textual features from movie reviews.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of various AI and ML models to determine the most effective approach for sentiment analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **NLP Libraries:** Utilize Natural Language Processing libraries such as NLTK and spaCy for text analysis.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** Apply state-of-the-art ML frameworks, including scikit-learn and TensorFlow.
- **Python:** The project is implemented using Python programming language.




# SMS Spam Detection Model

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages into SPAM or HAM (normal) categories based on their textual content. Natural Language Processing techniques are applied for effective text analysis.

## Features Engineered
- `word_count`: Calculated the number of words in each SMS message.
- `contains_currency_symbol`: Checked whether the SMS contains a currency symbol.
- `contains_number`: Identified if the SMS includes numerical values.

## Project Purpose
This model is designed to assist in filtering and cleaning SMS messages on mobile phones. By automatically classifying messages, users can easily differentiate between spam and legitimate messages, enhancing overall SMS management.

## Resources Used
### Packages
- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- nltk

### Dataset
The project utilizes the SMS Spam Collection Dataset available on Kaggle, provided by UCI Machine Learning. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Explored NaN values in the dataset.
- Plotted a countplot to visualize the distribution of SMS labels (Spam vs. Ham).
